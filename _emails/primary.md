Dear ..TITLE.. ..LASTNAME..,

I am writing you as a concerned citizen who is looking for your support in the Appropriations committee for the _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act,_ a law designed by an Advanced Placement government class in New Jersey. This legislation was passed into law in January 2019, and currently is seeking necessary funding. The law seeks justice for victims of civil rights cold cases by facilitating the release of cold case documents to the public. Unfortunately, previous efforts for justice, such as the Emmett Till Act, have resulted in no prosecutions from the Department of Justice while investigative reporters, historians, and local prosecutors have had a measure of success in re-opening and obtaining prosecutions in these cases.

At present, the government takes too long to release these files and is too inclined to withhold or redact key information. This review board, modeled after the one created by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, will be able to expedite the release of these files and balance the public’s interest in resolving these historical injustices with the government’s need to protect sources and methods.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act_ “would not significantly increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits.” As such, necessary funding by the Appropriations committee would present no additional burden to the taxpayers. It’s my hope that you will urge your colleagues in the Appropriations committee to take measures to secure the funding this legislation is entitled to.

Thank you!

Sincerely,
