Dear ..TITLE.. ..LASTNAME..,

I am writing you as a concerned citizen who is looking for your support in passing a law, designed by an Advanced Placement government class in New Jersey, titled the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act. This law will create an independent review board that will facilitate the release of records regarding civil rights cold cases to the public. Unfortunately, previous efforts, such as the Emmett Till Act, have resulted in no prosecutions from the Department of Justice while investigative reporters, historians, and local prosecutors have had a measure of success in re-opening and obtaining prosecutions in these cases.

At present, the government takes too long to release these files and is too inclined to withhold or redact key information. A review board, such as the one created by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, will be able to expedite the release of these files and balance the public's interest in resolving these historical injustices with the governmentâ€™s need to protect sources and methods.

The bill (H.R. 1272) has already been introduced into the House of Representatives and gained measures of success in the media, including a publication in Politico and an interview on NPR. Its companion bill, S. 3191, has already passed in the Senate.

It's my hope that as a representative of the people, you'll take measures to help push this important piece of legislation through Congress and see its vision become a reality.

Thank you!

Sincerely,
