Dear ..TITLE.. ..LASTNAME..,

I am writing you as a concerned citizen who is looking for your support on the Nominations for the _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act,_ a law designed by an Advanced Placement government class in New Jersey. This legislation was passed into law in January 2019, and currently is seeking necessary funding. The law seeks justice for victims of civil rights cold cases by facilitating the release of cold case documents to the public. 

Section 5 of the law essentially creates a Review Board to facilitate the release of these records, and I am asking that your Congressional office urge the President to appoint the 5 nominees that the legislation is entitled to. This manner is time sensitive as the families of these vicitms are passing on without receiving justice and closure. Additionally, the Cold Case group has already recieved support in their 2020-2021 Appropriations, but without this board, their efforts are redundant. I appreciate your support on this bill.


Thank you!

Sincerely,
